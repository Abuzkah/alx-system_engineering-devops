Postmortem Report: 502 Error - Database Connection Failure

Summary: On January 21st, 2024, at 15:45 GMT, an incident occurred resulting in a 502 error and temporary unavailability of a web application. The issue was promptly addressed after identifying and resolving a database connection failure within the web stack.

Timeline:

15:45 UTC: Elevated reports of users experiencing a 502 error while accessing the web application.

15:50 UTC: Initial investigation initiated; confirmed the web server was responding, but the application was unable to establish a connection to the database.

15:55 UTC: Checked database server status; found no issues with the database server itself.

16:00 UTC: Reviewed application logs, revealing repeated database connection timeout errors.

16:10 UTC: Analyzed database configuration files, confirming correct credentials and connection parameters.

16:15 UTC: Attempted to manually connect to the database using command-line tools; successful connection established.

16:20 UTC: Investigated network connectivity between the web and database servers; no anomalies found.

16:25 UTC: Recognized a sudden increase in traffic; suspected a potential database overload.

16:30 UTC: Adjusted database connection pool settings to accommodate increased traffic and reduce connection timeout.

16:35 UTC: Monitored application logs; observed a gradual decline in database connection timeout errors.

16:40 UTC: Verified that the 502 error rate reduced significantly.

16:45 UTC: Web application restored to normal operation; users reported successful access.

Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the 502 error was identified as a temporary overload on the database server, leading to connection timeouts. The increased traffic, likely due to a sudden surge in user activity, caused the database connections to reach their limit. The resolution involved adjusting the connection pool settings to allow for a higher capacity, preventing future timeouts and ensuring stable connections between the web and database servers.

Corrective and Preventive Measures:

Scalability Planning:
Conduct regular capacity planning exercises to anticipate and accommodate sudden increases in traffic. Implement auto-scaling mechanisms to dynamically adjust resources based on demand.

Real-time Monitoring:
Enhance real-time monitoring of web and database servers to quickly identify performance bottlenecks. Set up alerts for abnormal spikes in traffic or database connection errors.

Load Testing:
Conduct periodic load testing to simulate varying levels of traffic and identify potential issues before they impact users. Use load testing results to adjust system configurations proactively.

Documentation:
Maintain up-to-date documentation for system configurations, especially those related to database connections. Ensure all team members are familiar with troubleshooting procedures for common issues.

Post-Incident Review:
Conduct a detailed post-incident review to analyze the response and identify areas for improvement. Implement any necessary changes in processes or configurations based on lessons learned. By implementing these corrective and preventive measures, the team aims to enhance the system's resilience, minimize downtime, and proactively address potential issues to ensure a seamless user experience.
